$0 : long term backup

This script process all db server dumps existing in the environment
$ENVIRONMENT (or the env in the '-e' option), and saves the oldest
dump files/databases from GAP days ago into long term storage. At
the end all long term backups older than $RETENTION days are purged.

Options:

    -e <environment> : environemnt to process (default = $ENVIRONMENT)
    -h               : this help text
