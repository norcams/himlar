# logrotate
# 2022-01-07 (mikaeld): some issue on network nodes, especially in OSL, have the effect that one of the nodes
# in the cluster is logging a LOT! Until this is fixed we set up a more agressive log rotation
#
# One of the downsides is that we do not have control of how far back we have logs:
# On nodes with extensive logging: as low as 14 hours (hourly rotation due to more than 100 MB/hour)
# On nodes with a more normal log ratio: as far bask as several weeks (might be more than one full day until reached the 100 MB limit)
# 
# We may rotate every hour regardless (drop the 100 MB requirement) and raise the 'rotate' parameter, but then most nodes will have 
# a large number of very small rotated log files and be more cumbersome to wade through.
